  <p>My name is Monica Mendez. I am a mother of 4 and have 3 grand children. I live in New Mexico with my
  husband and son who is attending UNM. I love being active and learning new things. I love volunteer work and currently considering the Sheriff's Civilian Program.
      I am also interested in triathlons and when I am not working you will find me training, volunteering or reading a great book.</p>
