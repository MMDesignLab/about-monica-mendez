<h1>About Monica Mendez</h1>
    <img src="./images/monica-mendez.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>

  <p>My name is Monica "Money" Mendez. I am a mother of 4 and have 3 grand children. I live in New Mexico with my
  husband and son who is attending UNM. I love being active and learning new things. I love volunteer work and currently considering the Sheriff's Civilian Program.
      I am also interested in triathlons and when I am not working you will find me training, volunteering or reading a great book.</p>

<h2>My Amazing Adventures!!!</h2>


<p>I have seen and dined with Bigfoot, swam with mermaids, and ascended Olympus Mons on Jupiter.</p>
